<h1 class="about">About</h1> <h2 style="color: white;">Objectives</h2> <p class="large"> This project is a Motion Detection and Security Notify System that aims to automate the process of detecting motion, capturing screenshots, and recording videos when motion is detected in a given area. The system uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect motion and a camera module to capture visual data. The captured data is then stored in a storage unit, which can be accessed remotely through a web-based interface or a mobile application. The system is designed to be reliable, secure, and scalable, and can be used in various applications, including surveillance, security, and home automation.</p> <p class="large">The system is built using various technologies, including Python, Flask, and OpenCV, among others. Flask is used to build the web-based interface that allows users to access the system remotely, while OpenCV is used for image processing and motion detection. The system uses a camera module that captures visual data and processes it using machine learning algorithms to detect motion. When motion is detected, the system captures screenshots and records videos that can be accessed remotely through the web-based interface or mobile application.</p> <p class="large">The system can be used for various applications, including surveillance and security, home automation, and monitoring of public spaces. For instance, the system can be used to monitor a home or office and notify the owner when motion is detected in the premises. The system can also be used in public spaces to monitor security and detect suspicious activities. Additionally, the system can be used for home automation by integrating it with other smart devices to automate various tasks. Overall, the Motion Detection and Security Notify System is a valuable tool for enhancing security and automation in various applications.</p>
